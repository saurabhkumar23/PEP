count no of subseq. - https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/PcNkrILFWV
input - "abc"
output - 8
approach - faith is that "bc" will give me its subseq count as 4 then I will return 4+4=8. for base case i will return 1.

get all subseq. - https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/65XbUYTqN4
input - "abc"
output - [ "", a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc ]
approach - faith is that "bc" will give me its subseq as ["", b, c, bc] then I will append and neglect 'a' for all of them. for base case i will return [""].
